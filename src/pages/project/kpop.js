            After the birth of H.O.T, referred to as the first K-POP idol group, in 1996, K-POP culture has rapidly evolved. 
            However, this evolution has been closely intertwined with the advancement of media. 
            The generational differences in K-POP culture due to media evolution are distinctly evident. 
            Therefore, this infographic aims to visually represent these differences. 
            Furthermore, I hope that this infographic can provide insights into the future changes in K-POP culture.
