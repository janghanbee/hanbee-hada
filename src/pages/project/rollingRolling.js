            We seems to be living a life of rolling around and not even having a time to breathe, like a ball rolling along a set path. 
            But as this song says, if you look back, each day may have been more meaningful than you think. 
            Someday, the day will come when we can achieve our dreams and freedom that we've been longing for.
