            Just like children grow while playing, we always had special mates, “game”, by our side during our childhood days. 
            These plays not only brought joy but also contributed to our growth. 
            So, the character's abilities symbolize both the character's traits and the skills we acquired through childhood play. 
            I wanted to convey the meaning of, the plays that stayed by our side, eventually gave us various abilities, fostering our growth.

            By selecting a chalkboard-style layout, I aimed to evoke nostalgia for the past. 
            Back in those days, how were you? How about taking a moment to reflect on your childhood days?
